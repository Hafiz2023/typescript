/* Q.45 Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object.
        The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name.
        It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments.
        Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature.
        Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly. */

    "model name": name,
    keywords,

console.log(storeInfo("Honda", "2022"));
