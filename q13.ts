//Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”
let faverite_2= ["Road Prince", "Kawasaki" ,"Honda cs70"]
console.log(faverite_2 [2] + " is ki wja ya ha ky mere pass bhi yahi  bike ha.");
